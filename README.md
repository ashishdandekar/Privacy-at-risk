# Privacy-at-risk

The repository provides basic formulae and a sample code to instantiate "Privacy at risk" for the Laplace mechanism.
The details are part of the paper in PoPETS 2021. The preprint of the paper can be found at: https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.0097.

This repository contains following files:
  1. formule.py: It contains formulae for privacy at risk for the Laplace mechanism.
  2. composition.py: It contains composition theorem with privacy at risk.
  3. new_expt.py: It contains the simulation for the illustration in the Section 6 of the paper. 
  
The illustration makes use of a cleaned sample from US 2000 dataset. We have removed the original IDs from the dataset for the purpose of anonymisation.
